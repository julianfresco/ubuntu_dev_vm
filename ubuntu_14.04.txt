Preparing your workstation
=================================================

You will need the following:

1. Oracle VirtualBox - download latest version
2. ISO file of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
3. Create a folder where files will be shared between both devices, i.e. "/sandbox"

=================================================

Creating the VM:

1. Open Virtual Box, the click New
	- add a Name, Type = Linux, OS Version = Ubuntu 64-bit. Click Continue.
	- use at least 1024 MB. Click Continue.
	- select Create a virtual hard drive (default). Click Create.
	- select Hard Drive File Type if you want to image the machine and port it somewhere else. Otherwise, default is fine.
	- select Fixed size. Click Continue.
	- select folder name, location, and size - defaults should be fine. Click Create.

2. Configure the VM
	- Select your VM from the left margin, and click Settings

		- Under processor tab, check Enable PAE/NX
	b. Storage Configuration
		- In Storage Tree on left, click the CD icon under Controller: IDE
		- on the right, click the CD icon, then "Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file" to select the Ubuntu ISO file. 
	c. Audio Configuration
